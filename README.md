This will be a repository of a set of tools use in the lab. 

# Disparity simulator
This is a tool to simulate and visualize disparities in 3D. Caused by either eye movements or displacements and slant/tilts of the stimulus. 

To run, download or clone the respository and just run the matlab command from the repository folder 
```
>> Geometry3D.demoDisparity
```
Then this graphical interactive tool should open:

# Quaternion simulator
This is a tool to visualze a quaternion (sort of) and the equivalent eye position in either Helmholtz (first vertical then horizontal) or Fick (first horizontal then vertical)

To run, download or clone the respository and just run the matlab command from the repository folder 
```
>> Geometry3D.demoQuaternion
```
